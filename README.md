# Hello World! 
- 👋 I’m @Natelij
- 👀 I’m interested one site in data science, especially on the management, visualization, analysis and evaluation of data, on the other site in web development and web design
- 🌱 I am currently learning or expanding my knowledge about the content of the Bible, English for nerds and humen being, PowerShell, LaTeX, markdown, XML, HTML, CSS, json, ECMAScript, PHP, Excel, MySQL and SQL-Server, Python and R ...
- 💞️ In our time we need ethical standards and users of them - especially for AI and robotics. I am therefore looking for exchange and collaboration with people in the web developement and data science environment. I prefer to speak German because my English is currently not so good without Google Translator.
