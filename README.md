- 👋 Hello World, I’m @Natelij
- 👀 I’m interested one site in data science, especially on the management, visualization, analysis and evaluation of data, on the other site in web development and web design
- 🌱 I am currently learning or expanding my knowledge of the Bible, English for Nerds, PowerShell, LaTeX, XML, HTML, CSS, ECMAScript, Json, Markdown, PHP, Excel, MySQL and MSSQL Server, Python and R ...
- 💞️ In our time we need ethical standards and users of them - especially for AI and robotics. I am therefore looking for exchange and collaboration with people in the web developement and data science environment. I'd be happy to speak German, as my English isn't that good without Google Translator.
